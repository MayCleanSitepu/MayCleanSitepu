# Hi! I'm klinnn - May Clean

## 👨‍💻 About Me
Hi there! I'm **May Clean Sitepu**, a passionate full-stack developer with a strong inclination towards **full-stack engineering** (literally full-stack — from networking to apps).  
I love diving into animations, 3D, and **automation for web testing** ensuring features and real-time interactions run smoothly.

🌟 My interests range from building visually appealing UIs to crafting immersive 3D experiences, as well as designing **automated testing workflows for web applications**. Whether it's modern frameworks, end-to-end testing, or pushing the boundaries of web animations, I’m always eager to learn and innovate.
